### 2.1. Prerequisites

This project requires Java 1.8, MySQL (or Postgres / H2) and Maven.

### 2.2. Installing

#### 2.2.1 Database operations.
Execute the content of `.sql` files, such as:
```
article.sql
article_category.sql
article_type.sql
chart_type.sql
dashboard_query.sql
data.sql
first_name.sql
inventory.sql
inventory_status.sql
inventory_type.sql
last_name.sql
unit_industry.sql
unit_of_measure.sql
unit_type.sql
```

##### 2.2.1.1 MySql 
After MySQL installation, it is required to create a database:

```
CREATE DATABSE oms;
```

Note: in case that you run the application starting with MySQL 8.0.4, please execute the following query:
```
ALTER USER '${USER}'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '${PASSWORD}';
-- where ${USER} and ${PASSWORD} should be provided. 
```

##### 2.2.1.2 Postgres
Install PostgreSQL. It is required to create a database:

Please, run the following commands if it is the case:
```
createuser -U postgres -s Progress
```

Please, run the following command to import a database (if it is the case):
```
pg_restore -d DATABASE_NAME <  PATH/BACKUP_FILE_NAME.sql
```

##### 2.2.1.3 H2
No installation is required.
The `spring.datasource.url` is the one required property which should be set. By default, the
username is `sa` with empty password. Two modes: in memory and file storage. See the `application.properties`
file for more details related configuration.

#### 2.2. Run the application.
In case of this exception: 
```
Unable to make field private com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment$DiscoveredProcessors com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment.discoveredProcs accessible: module jdk.compiler does not "opens com.sun.tools.javac.processing" to unnamed module
```
Change the project version from java 16 to java 8: Click-right on the project (F4 on Windows) -> Open Module Settings -> Project -> Project SDK.

All this files contains initial data. Just copy and paste the file's content Go to downloaded folder and create the build (you should have something similar like the following):
